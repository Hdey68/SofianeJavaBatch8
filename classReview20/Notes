FileHandling in Java:
Reading and Writing the data to files is called file handling, we have 2 main classes
FileInputStream and FileOutputStream that we use to handle files.
Whenever we have to read the data from the file we use FileInputStream and
whenever we have to write the data we use FileOutputStream.

Properties files contain the configuration data in the form of key and value pairs.
